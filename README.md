Thank you for responding to my message on the group 

The app has been built already 

Problem is that it doesn't work outside the development PC 

It returns error 

Could not load file or assembly '*.dll' or one of its dependencies

*************************************
Uchenna here. 

Please have you faced a similar problem 

In your journey so far 

How did you handle it?
*************************************

I have tried almost all responses from chatGPT and stack overflow but don't seem to be able to make it work

Maybe I lack fundamental understanding because I am new to the framework 

For context,  

I copied the vs code project folder directly to the tagert system and ran same project and JT didn't work 


While the same project works in development pc

******************************************************
All and dependencies are present in the same folder They were in the development PC where it was working
**************************************************
I used install forge to create a . EXE file 

It Installed correctly 

But the program did not work well as it had the dll error earlier stated
************************************************
That was before I had the idea to just copy the vs project folder since both PC has visual studio installed
****************************************
I have no idea how to

I tried dependency walker but I was not able to identify anything. 

Like I said. 

I am not an expert...  Just learning as I go.  

That's why I am seeking a more professional help debugging it.
